## Welcome to CanIUse INSPIRE

In this repository we document which features of INSPIRE GML and any alternative encodings (such as the GeoJSON encoding currently under development) can be used in which software product. The repository is created as part of the MIG 2017.3 action work to improve the usability of INSPIRE Data.

We have test several client applications, including:

* QGIS 2.18 and QGIS 3.4  
* Esri ArcMap 10.5
* Esri ArcGIS Online
* OpenLayers 3
* Leaflet 1.4
* OGR
* Safe Software FME
* wetransform hale studio

We are specifically testing for a wide range of features and how they are supported. The list of features and their definition can be found here:

* [GeoJSON tests](docs/geoJSON.md)
* [GML tests](docs/gml.md)
