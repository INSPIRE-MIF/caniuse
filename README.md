## Welcome to CanIUse INSPIRE

In this repository we document which features of INSPIRE GML and any alternative encodings (such as the GeoJSON encoding currently under development) can be used in which software product. This repository is created as part of the MIG 2017.3 work to improve the usability of INSPIRE Data.

We will test several client applications, including but not limited to:

* QGIS 2.18 and QGIS 3.4  
* Esri ArcMap 10.5
* Esri ArcGIS Online
* OpenLayers 3
* Leaflet 1.4
* OGR
* Safe Software FME
* wetransform hale studio

We are specifically testing for a wide range of features and how they are supported. The list of features and their definition can be found here:

* [GeoJSON tests](docs/geoJSON.md)
* [GML tests](docs/gml.md)

### Results

The results from tests with different client applications are available [here](generator/caniuse-20190329_AK.html)
