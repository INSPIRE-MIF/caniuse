## Welcome to CanIUse INSPIRE

In this repository we document which features of INSPIRE GML and any alternative encodings (such as the GeoJSON encoding currently under development) can be used in which software. This repository is created as part of the MIG 2017.3 work to improve INSPIRE Data Interoperability.

We will test several applications, including but not limited to:

* Esri ArcMap
* QGIS
* OpenLayers
* Leaflet
* Safe Software FME
* wetransform hale studio
